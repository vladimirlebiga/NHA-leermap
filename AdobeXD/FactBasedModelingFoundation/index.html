        <h1>What is Fact Based Modeling</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>
          Fact based modeling (FBM) is a methodology (both notation(=structure)
          and protocol (=structuring)) for modeling the semantics of a subject
          area (i.e. the universe of discourse, the domain of interest) for the
          purpose of, for example, developing information systems, developing or
          applying laws or other rule systems or sharing information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main purpose of fact based modeling is to capture as much of the
          semantics as possible, to validate intermediate and final results with
          the subject matter expert in his preferred language, preferably using
          concrete illustrations and to remain independent of the representation
          for a specific implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling or object-oriented modeling,
          fact based modeling treats all facts as relationships (unary, binary,
          ternary etc.). How facts are grouped into structures (e.g.
          attribute-based entity types, classes, relation schemes, XML schemas)
          is considered a software design level, implementation issue that is
          irrelevant to the capturing of business semantics. Avoiding attributes
          in the base model enhances semantic stability and understandability.
          Fact based modeling facilitates natural verbalization and thus enables
          productive communication with all stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fact based modeling provides the means to capture the knowledge of the
          domain experts in terms of "what" (i.e. the user requirements). FBM is
          conceptual, hence free of any software implementation bias. Fact Based
          Modeling adheres to the Conceptualization and 100% principle of ISO
          TR9007.
        </p>
        <p>
          FBM is based on logic and controlled natural language, whereby the
          resulting fact based model (the conceptual data model) captures the
          semantics of the domain of interest by means of fact types, together
          with the associated concept definitions and the integrity and
          derivation rules applying to populations (facts) associated with these
          fact types.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact based models are used as a basis to derive implementation
          specific:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            logical data models, such as ER, UML, relational and hierarchical
            models;
          </li>
          <li>physical data models, such as SQL, XSD.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The roots of fact based modeling can be traced to research into and
          application in business of semantic modeling for information systems
          during the 1970s. Subsequently, several developments have taken place
          in parallel, resulting in several fact based modeling “dialects”,
          including NIAM, ORM2, CogNIAM, DOGMA and FCO-IM.
