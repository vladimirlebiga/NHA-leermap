        <h1>Objectives of the fact based modeling working group</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>
          The main objective of the FBM WG is to transfer many years of research
          and business practice in the domain of semantic modeling to industry
          to enable industry to develop, reuse and share knowledge effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Acknowledging the existence of fact based modeling methods to produce
          high quality, validated solutions (e.g. relational database systems),
          the FBM WG focuses on the means to achieve semantic interoperability
          between existing modeling notations and tools by incorporating the
          best of each of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this purpose, the FBM WG has initiated the production of an
          exchange schema that provides the means for sharing domain specific
          conceptual data models. This exchange schema will be developed
          according the the FBM protocol and expressed in each of the notations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the exchange schema has reached enough maturity, including
          extensive validation and checking with real business users and
          business modelers, the plan of the FBM WG is to propose this exchange
          schema for adoption by international standardization organizations.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to achieve interoperability with model notations and
          techniques frequently used in industry, mappings to the most common
          modeling notations and techniques (e.g. UML, relational, E/R, OWL,
          XSD) are also in the scope of future activities of the working group.
